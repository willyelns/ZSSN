# ZSSN - Zombie Survival Social Network

The ZSSN is a Social Network developed to help the survivors of a devastating zombie apocalipse. In this network, you can register others survivors you meet along the way, save and update your last location (in case you get in trouble your group will have a head start!), flag a survivor as infected (and save your group from a surprise attack!) and even see reports about your group of survivors status!

This project was developed by Willyelns Xavier.

## Framework
The framework used to develop the project was [AngularJS]

## How to run
Run the following instruction in terminal:
 - npm install -g http-server
 - cd into project folder
 -  run http-server -o (to open the browser to the page)

During the development process, I was running it locally. 

## Structure
The struct of this project:
 - styles: CSS project file
 - scripts and survivor: Javascripts files fo the project
 - imags folder: folder with images used during the project, representing survivors for example
 - node_modules folder: folder containing angular files

## HTML Pages
 There is only one page, "index.html". Considering the zombie apocalipse,
 it would be easier and faster for survivors to navigate and use Social Network 
 through modals. That way they won't need to leave the main page to use others functions.
